# Syrian-Refugee-Crisis (Data Visualization-SpatialAnalysis)
**Tools**: QGIS | Flourish | Excel  
**Period Covered**: 2011‚Äì2023

This repository visualizes the human and geographic dimensions of the Syrian refugee crisis, combining geospatial analysis and data storytelling to trace migration routes, 
host countries, demographics, and humanitarian efforts. Using QGIS for mapping and Flourish for interactive charts, the project transforms raw data from UNHCR, 3RP, and global reports into 
a cohesive visual narrative that highlights the immense scale and human impact of displacement.

## üéØ Objectives
- Map major refugee flows from Syria (2011‚Äì2023).
- Identify key host countries and migration corridors.
- Visualize demographic and humanitarian data to reveal underlying social realities.
- Demonstrate how geospatial tools and data visualization can enrich digital humanities research.

## üó∫Ô∏è Data & Methods
- QGIS for mapping origin cities, migration routes, and major camps.
  - Thematic maps cover 2011‚Äì2013, 2015‚Äì2019, and 2020‚Äì2023.
  - Additional layers show borders, fences, and humanitarian access zones.
- Excel for data cleaning and harmonization of diverse sources.
- Flourish for creating interactive timelines, demographic charts, and donor visualizations.
